    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am an open-source contributor who focuses on understanding existing
      systems before making changes. I prefer small, well-scoped contributions
      that are easy to review, test, and maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience includes working on documentation, tests, and bug fixes
      across large, real-world projects, collaborating closely with maintainers
      to iterate based on review feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Summer of Bitcoin</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        My interest in Bitcoin is centered on understanding the system at a
        protocol and network level rather than price movements. I am familiar
        with the UTXO model, transaction structure, and how transactions are
        validated and ordered into blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through building Bitcoin-related tools and contributing to open source,
        I want to deepen my understanding of Bitcoin internals while contributing
        meaningful improvements to production Bitcoin software through Summer of
        Bitcoin.
